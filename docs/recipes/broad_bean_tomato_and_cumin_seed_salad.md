## Ingredients
- 500g broad beans
- 200g mixed heirloom cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 large green chilli, finely diced
- 1 handful of coriander, leaves chopped
- 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and crushed
- 1 preserved lemon, skin only
- 3~4 spring onions, chopped
- juice of 1 lemon
- 2.5 tbsp olive oil


??? note

    You can substitute fresh broad beans with tinned (butter beans, cannellini beans, etc). If doing so, just rinse them and skip step #1.


## Method
1. Blanch the broad beans by putting them in boiling water for 1~2 minutes. Drain and cool under cold running water, then slip off the skins.
2. Put the peeled broad beans in a large bowl and add the remaining ingredients. Mix gently to combine.


!!! tip

    If making this salad in advance, prepare and combine all of the ingredients except the lemon juice and olive oil. Cover and refrigerate, adding the dressing ingredients when you are ready to serve.
